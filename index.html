  <h1>WILDLIFE CONSERVATION</h1>
  <p> <strong>At Wildlife Conservation</strong>
    <span> we intended to take AWF’s work to a new scale and use the capacity of Africa’s
    burgeoning private sector to do more, in more places, for the benefit of conservation and people.

          <p> <br>Studying animals and their habitats<br> can be a valuable learning experience for students<br> of all ages.
            Dr. Eric Jensen at the University of<br> Warwick has written about the<br> educational benefits of trips to the
            zoo
            <br> for children. Failures in wildlife conservation<br> may leave teachers with fewer educational<br> resources.</p>

      <h3>Creating community conservancies.</h3>

      <p>By providing funding to organizations like Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), sniffer dogs are trained to detect illegal
        animal products such as ivory and rhino horns. In some cases, sniffer dogs are also used to locate poachers.</p>

      <p>Working directly with communities—and making sure members get direct benefits from conservation efforts—creates a positive
        impact for all. For example, in Zambia, elephants and other wildlife roam freely outside of protected areas, but
        development was threatening these historic wildlife habitats. At the same time, communities were having a hard and
        sometimes attack livestock belonging to pastoralists. AWF has helped communities create conservancies or wildlife
        management areas where locals agree to protect the natural resources</p>

      <h4>Incentivizing conservation and underscoring its importance.</h4>

      <p>Many villagers living near Ruaha National Park don’t understand the importance of conservation, or the value of the
        park for both conservation efforts and the local economy. To foster greater awareness of these issues, Ruaha Carnivore
        Project regularly brings villagers into the park on educational trips, letting them learn about the importance of
        protecting large carnivores first hand.</p>
      <p>Additionally, this carnivore conservation project provides community benefits to villages that demonstrate success
        in living peacefully with top predators. This can include scholarships, medical care and access to veterinary services;
        communities vote to determine which benefits they receive. By pairing these incentives with education about conservation,
        Ruaha Carnivore Project is fostering a much-needed shift in the local opinion of carnivores.</p>
