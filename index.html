    <strong>At Wildlife Conservation</strong>
    <span> we intended to take AWF’s work to a new scale and use the capacity of Africa’s
    burgeoning private sector to do more, in more places, for the benefit of conservation and people.

  <h3>Creating community conservancies.</h3>
  <p>By providing funding to organizations like Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), sniffer dogs are trained to detect illegal animal
    products such as ivory and rhino horns. In some cases, sniffer dogs are also used to locate poachers.</p>

  <p>Working directly with communities—and making sure members get direct benefits from conservation efforts—creates a positive
    impact for all. For example, in Zambia, elephants and other wildlife roam freely outside of protected areas, but development
    was threatening these historic wildlife habitats. At the same time, communities were having a hard and sometimes attack
    livestock belonging to pastoralists. AWF has helped communities create conservancies or wildlife management areas where
    locals agree to protect the natural resources</p>

    <h4>Incentivizing conservation and underscoring its importance.</h4>

    <p>Many villagers living near Ruaha National Park don’t understand the importance of conservation, or the value of the park
      for both conservation efforts and the local economy. To foster greater awareness of these issues, Ruaha Carnivore Project
      regularly brings villagers into the park on educational trips, letting them learn about the importance of protecting
      large carnivores first hand.</p>
    <p>Additionally, this carnivore conservation project provides community benefits to villages that demonstrate success in
      living peacefully with top predators. This can include scholarships, medical care and access to veterinary services;
      communities vote to determine which benefits they receive. By pairing these incentives with education about conservation,
      Ruaha Carnivore Project is fostering a much-needed shift in the local opinion of carnivores.</p>
